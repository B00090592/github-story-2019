        As the family rode north into dark frosty territory they stumbled upon a hunting tragedy involving a pack of
        Dire wolfs and a might stag rarely found this far north.  Ned stark lord of Winterfell and warden of the north was
        first to climb down from his horse and investigate the carcass of the dead stag clearly being devoured by the
        pack ned stark himself followed another blood trail down to the a small hill to the waters edge and as walk
        the blood trail got thicker so he knew he was getting close.

	He finally stumbled on a dead mother dire wolf that was killed while trying 
	to take down the stag during their hunt. The stags antlers pierced the wolves 
	chest during the struggle. The wolf mother only few day old pups were till suckling on 
	their mothers breast for food.  At this time, the  family of starks had followed their 
	father down to the dead animal followed by Theon(ned starks ward) and Jon snow(neds bastard son). Ned stark thought to kill the pups as they wouldn’t survive without their mother but quickly changed his mind when Jon pointed out that there are five pups one dire wolf for each of the stark children but what really convinced ned the dire wolf is actually the flag Sigel of house Stark which Jon claimed it was faith, that they were meant to have them. Following agreeing with Ned Stark
	instructs the family of starks the pups were there responsibly and there’s alone.
