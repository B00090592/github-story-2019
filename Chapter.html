        As the family rode north into dark frosty territory they stumbled upon a hunting tragedy involving a pack of
        Dire wolfs and a might stag rarely found this far north.  Ned stark lord of Winterfell and warden of the north was
        first to climb down from his horse and investigate the carcass of the dead stag clearly being devoured by the
        pack ned stark himself followed another blood trail down to the a small hill to the waters edge and as walk
        the blood trail got thicker so he knew he was getting close.
