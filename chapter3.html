    <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
    <h3>Game of thrones</h3>
    <p>After contemplating his kings offer for a few days ned decides to accept. After spending one last night with his family ned said Farwell to some of his family as he decided to bring two daughters Arya and Sansa along with his bastard son Jon snow. Jon snow parted the company of his family shortly after setting out from Winterfell. Jon snow was heading to join the ancient brotherhood of the nights watch as he had nothing to inherit due to his status.</p>
    <p>Before leaving for the Castel black ( Nights watch Stronghold ) Jon snow and ned say a last farewell. On the kings road ned and Robert discuss a growing threat in the east across the narrow sea. Daenerys Targaryen which is the daughter of the king that ned and Robert over threw in the rebellion many years ago. A few days prior when her father lost his throne he ordered his most loyal soldiers to sail Daenerys and his last remaining son Viseryâ€™s to sail across the narrow sea into exile to keep them safe.</p>
    <p>Roberts concern is justified as Daenerys has been wed to a Dothraki horse lord Khal Drogo a commander of a great legion at his back. Robert insists she must be killed before she gets a chance to invade but Ned is a man of honour and will have nothing to do with the killing of nothing more than a child.</p>
